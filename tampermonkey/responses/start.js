`Hey, I saw your post on r/NoFap. It&apos;s great to see you&apos;re starting with your journey and taking it seriously! How are you currently coping?

Definitely meditation was what made the biggest difference for me. In fact, within 5 minutes of meditation was when I knew I would never relapse again and here I am at 250+ days. What&apos;s hard is convincing people to do it though, myself included. I resisted for years, but the moment I started doing it, I felt like such an idiot for being so stubborn haha.

Meditation also isn&apos;t effective if it&apos;s not consistent. It&apos;s a bit like dieting. You can&apos;t just diet for a week, and then splurge afterwards. It&apos;s about creating that lifestyle of balance and developing a mental health routine which allows you to develop control over your mind. So definitely it&apos;s something you should be doing daily.

So for me, I basically do 10 minutes of meditation each day and I would say that&apos;s enough for you to get started.

Thought you could use some advice to help you get further with your own recovery :D`

`The biggest difference is probably the energy I have now. Like, put it this way, I haven&apos;t thought about porn in months. Which means I haven&apos;t experienced any of the guilt/shame/drain of porn on a daily basis, not to mention my emotions have remained stable and it&apos;s literally night and day in terms of difference. This alone is a huge motivator never to go back.`
