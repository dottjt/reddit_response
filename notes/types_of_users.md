## User Types

I thought it might be useful to catalogue the different types of users, so it can help me understand the kind of data that I require.

- Users I've never messaged before.
  - User in database - No messages from me.
- Users I've messaged, but didn't get back.
  + User in database - One message from me, no message from them.
- User I've messaged, and has gotten back to me.
  + User in database - One message from me, one message from them.
