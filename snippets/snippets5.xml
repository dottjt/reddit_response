				<title>Guide - Plain</title>
				<content>Well, I&apos;ve written a guide to the whole process of overcoming porn addiction if you&apos;re interested?

It explains everything from healthy coping mechanisms, to developing control over your emotions, as well as setting healthy expectations throughout your journey.

https://neverfapdeluxe.com/

The homepage is quite comprehensive. I&apos;ve put a lot of effort into it and it covers 90% of what you need to know. It then leads to the /guide which explains even more about awareness, meditation etc.

Also happy to have you join our #accountability channel on Discord once you&apos;ve become familiar with the material.</content>

				<title>meditation-advice</title>
				<content>Meditation is basically the difference between making it a few weeks, to making it a few years. Essentially, if you don&apos;t have control over your emotions by remaining calm, then it’s hard to say that you’re ultimately in control of anything.

Put it this way, I learnt more in the 2 weeks I spent meditating than in the other five years I spent doing everything else. I cannot recommend it enough, and here I am 4 months into NoFap and honestly, feeling invulnerable everyday.

I tend to find that meditation helps greatly to control my urges. Except, well, I don&apos;t have urges anymore simply due to meditation.
The problem is that once you have an urge, it&apos;s generally too late. Only by regularly training your mind can you have full control over your emotions and really have an easy time with NoFap.


(don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s 100% completely free, just trying to help as many people out as possible)



No worries! It&apos;s a lot of work building the website, but it will be worth it in the end to help others :)

Definitely the main feature is our Discord channel where I&apos;ve setup an accountability program.

Essentially you post once a day with the healthy coping mechanisms you practiced for that day, and the NeverFap Deluxe Bot helps keep you accountable and helps keep track of your progress. Not to mention we have a super friendly and open community, so let me know if you&apos;re interested!

I also have a subreddit if you&apos;re interested in keeping up-to-date with developments to the website, podcast etc. r/NeverFapDeluxe

Feel free to ask if you have any questions! I&apos;m more than happy to help!




Like, I literally learnt more in the 2 weeks I spent meditating than in the past 5 years trying everything else. I was doing cold showers, intermittent fasting etc. you name it, and meditation just like ...wow. For the first time in my life I&apos;d realised that I&apos;d been focusing on all the wrong things, but now I have full control over my mind and it&apos;s just fantastic.

				<title>meditation-practice</title>
				<content>Meditation essentially takes

What&apos;s going to help is if you calm down.

Only by calming down can you take take back control over your emotions, and act effectively, as opposed to struggling as you currently are. I understand that it&apos;s difficult, but you&apos;re making it difficult for yourself by choosing to react and not simply let go.


Ultimately, meditation is about being aware of your senses. So for example, sitting there and noticing your emotions and physical sensations without reacting to is, as well as observing your surroundings.

I learnt more in the 2 weeks I spent meditating than in the other five years I spent doing everything else.

It&apos;s basically the most healthy coping mechanism, and you can’t get through NoFap without a few of those.


When you&apos;re in control over your emotions, then you can remain calm and not relapse under these situations.

Of course, chances are that you are PMOing because you never had control over your emotions. Well, meditation will help you with that.</content>

				<title>Essentially, I learnt more within 5 minutes of meditation than I did in the previous 5 years doing literally everything else, because I knew within that moment I would have the tools to be able to have full control over my mind.</title>

				<title>saw</title>
				<content>Hey, I saw your post on r/NoFap.

I&apos;m currently 250+ days into my recovery, thought you could use some advice to help you get further with your own recovery :D</content>

				<title>start</title>
				<content>Hey, I saw your post on r/NoFap. It&apos;s great to see you&apos;re starting and taking your journey seriously! How are you currently coping?

Definitely meditation was what made the biggest difference for me. In fact, I knew within 5 minutes of meditation that I would never relapse again and here I am at 250+ days. It&apos;s hard convincing people to do it though, because I know I personally resisted it for years thinking it was pointless, but the moment I started doing it I felt like such an idiot for being so stubborn haha.

I think where most people go wrong is that they don&apos;t realise self-control and discipline comes from learning to let go in order to be calm and present. Instead, I think a lot of people think it&apos;s about forcing yourself through struggle or having &quot;willpower&quot;, but once you experience being truly calm and present with yourself, then it completely changes how you think about self-control.

So for me, I basically do 10 minutes of meditation each day and I would say that&apos;s enough for you to get started.

				<title>mental health plan</title>
				<content>Hey, I saw your post on r/NoFap. Essentially, it sounds to me like you don&apos;t have a solid mental health plan in place, because if you&apos;re meditating daily, it should be getting easier - not harder.

I&apos;m currently 250+ days into my recovery, thought you could use some advice to help you get further with your own recovery :D</content>

				<title>stubborn at first</title>
				<content>Almost everyone is stubborn at first. What usually happens is that people will resist for a few months, get fed up at their lack of progress, finally cave in and decided to meditate, then get angry at me for not pushing them to do it sooner haha. </content>
			</snippet>
			<snippet>
				<title>Biggest Difference</title>
				<content>The biggest difference is probably the energy I have now. Like, put it this way, I haven&apos;t thought about porn in months. Which means I haven&apos;t experienced any of the guilt/shame/drain of porn on a daily basis, not to mention my emotions have remained stable and it&apos;s literally night and day in terms of difference. This alone is a huge motivator never to go back.</content>

				<title>Meditation spritituality</title>
				<content>Actually, they&apos;re quite different things - it&apos;s a big misconception. It&apos;s a bit like saying that pray and going to the gym are the same thing. Meditation is a bit like going to the gym for your mind. But happy to see you&apos;re seeing those benefits :)

				<title>Sam Harris</title>
				<content>I started out with Sam Harris&apos; Waking Up App which was truly amazing, but it&apos;s paid and after the first free 10 meditations, that personally was enough for me to do it solo.</content>
			</snippet>
			<snippet>
				<title>consistency</title>
				<content>Yeah, meditation isn&apos;t effective if it&apos;s not consistent. It&apos;s a bit like dieting. You can&apos;t just diet for a week, and then splurge afterwards. It&apos;s about creating that lifestyle of balance and developing a mental health routine which allows you to develop control over your mind. So definitely it&apos;s something you should be doing daily.</content>
