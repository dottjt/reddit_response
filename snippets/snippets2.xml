				<title>Meditation - Biggest - Tease</title>
				<content>Well, meditation was what made the biggest difference for me. In fact, I knew within 5 minutes of meditation that I would never relapse again and here I am at 250+ days. It&apos;s hard convincing people to do it though, because I know I personally resisted it for years thinking it was pointless, but the moment I started doing it I felt like such an idiot for being so stubborn haha.

Like, I literally learnt more in the 2 weeks I spent meditating than in the past 5 years trying everything else. I was doing cold showers, intermittent fasting etc. you name it, and meditation just like ...wow. For the first time in my life I&apos;d realised that I&apos;d been focusing on all the wrong things, but now I have full control over my mind and it&apos;s just fantastic.

I think where most people go wrong is that they don&apos;t realise self-control and discipline comes from learning to let go in order to be calm and present. Instead, I think a lot of people think it&apos;s about forcing yourself through struggle or having &quot;willpower&quot;, but once you experience being truly calm and present with yourself, then it completely changes how you think about self-control.

So for me, I basically do 10 minutes of meditation each day and I would say that&apos;s enough for you to get started.

Have you read my guide to overcoming porn addiction before?</content>

				<content>Well, I&apos;ve written a guide to the whole process of overcoming porn addiction if you&apos;re interested? (don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s 100% completely free, just trying to help as many people out as possible)

It explains everything from healthy coping mechanisms, to developing control over your emotions, as well as setting healthy expectations throughout your journey.

The homepage is quite comprehensive. I&apos;ve put a lot of effort into it and it covers 90% of what you need to know. It then leads to the /guide which explains even more about awareness, meditation etc.

Also happy to have you join our #accountability channel on Discord once you&apos;ve become familiar with the material.</content>

				<title>Biggest Difference</title>
				<content>The biggest difference is probably the energy I have now. Like, put it this way, I haven&apos;t thought about porn in months. Which means I haven&apos;t experienced any of the guilt/shame/drain of porn on a daily basis, not to mention my emotions have remained stable and it&apos;s literally night and day in terms of difference. This alone is a huge motivator never to go back.</content>

				<title>meditation-practice</title>
				<content>Meditation essentially takes

What&apos;s going to help is if you calm down.

Only by calming down can you take take back control over your emotions, and act effectively, as opposed to struggling as you currently are. I understand that it&apos;s difficult, but you&apos;re making it difficult for yourself by choosing to react and not simply let go.


Ultimately, meditation is about being aware of your senses. So for example, sitting there and noticing your emotions and physical sensations without reacting to is, as well as observing your surroundings.

I learnt more in the 2 weeks I spent meditating than in the other five years I spent doing everything else.

It&apos;s basically the most healthy coping mechanism, and you canâ€™t get through NoFap without a few of those.


When you&apos;re in control over your emotions, then you can remain calm and not relapse under these situations.

Of course, chances are that you are PMOing because you never had control over your emotions. Well, meditation will help you with that.</content>
