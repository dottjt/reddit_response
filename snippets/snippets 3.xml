				<content>No worries!

Definitely the main feature is our Discord channel where I&apos;ve setup an accountability program.

Essentially you post once a day with the healthy coping mechanisms you practiced for that day, and our NFD bot interacts with you various ways, and it&apos;s proven super successful so far in keeping people committed. Not to mention we have a super friendly and open community, let me know if you&apos;re interested ^^

I also have a subreddit if you&apos;re interested in keeping up-to-date with developments to the website, podcast etc. r/NeverFapDeluxe</content>

				<title>Well, as I say. The reason why it takes people 5 years&apos; on average to overcome their porn addiction is because they spend 4 and a half years not commiting and doing everything under the sun except commit, before finally realising that they&apos;ve had enough and they&apos;re finally going to actually do something meaningful like meditate.</title>

				<content>Hey, flatline can mean a lot of different things, I wouldn&apos;t worry about it too much. Basically, it&apos;s just you withdrawing and setting expectations on that.
