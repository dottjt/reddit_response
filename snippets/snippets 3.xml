				<title>Meditation - Benefits</title>
				<content>Yeah, meditation was what made the biggest difference for me. In fact, within 5 minutes of meditation was when I knew I would never relapse again and here I am at 200+ days. What&apos;s hard is convincing people to do it though, myself included. I resisted for years, but the moment I started doing it, I felt like such an idiot for being so stubborn haha.

Have you checked out my website before? It explains quite a lot of this stuff, you might find it useful.

				<title>Meditation - Consistency</title>
				<content>Yeah, meditation isn&apos;t effective if it&apos;s not consistent. It&apos;s a bit like dieting. You can&apos;t just diet for a week, and then splurge afterwards. It&apos;s about creating that lifestyle of balance and developing a mental health routine which allows you to develop control over your mind. So definitely it&apos;s something you should be doing daily.

You may possibly be doing it wrong as well, I know I was for years without realising it. Like, are you doing it with your eyes closed? Because you&apos;re not supposed it.

				<title>meditation-advice</title>
				<content>
Just in regards to meditation, you might find this really helpful. It’s an article I wrote on the subject which explains it a little further:

https://neverfapdeluxe.com/articles/the-importance-of-meditation-for-porn-addiction/

In addition, I highly recommend Sam Harris’ waking up course. It’s what I personally started with and it’s been amazing.

Just remember, consistency is key. Meditation works only if you&apos;re consistent with it.


Meditation is basically the difference between making it a few weeks, to making it a few years. Essentially, if you don&apos;t have control over your emotions by remaining calm, then it’s hard to say that you’re ultimately in control of anything.


Put it this way, I learnt more in the 2 weeks I spent meditating than in the other five years I spent doing everything else. I cannot recommend it enough, and here I am 4 months into NoFap and honestly, feeling invulnerable everyday.


I tend to find that meditation helps greatly to control my urges. Except, well, I don&apos;t have urges anymore simply due to meditation.
The problem is that once you have an urge, it&apos;s generally too late. Only by regularly training your mind can you have full control over your emotions and really have an easy time with NoFap.

				<content>Meditation essentially takes


What&apos;s going to help is if you calm down.

Only by calming down can you take take back control over your emotions, and act effectively, as opposed to struggling as you currently are. I understand that it&apos;s difficult, but you&apos;re making it difficult for yourself by choosing to react and not simply let go.


Ultimately, meditation is about being aware of your senses. So for example, sitting there and noticing your emotions and physical sensations without reacting to is, as well as observing your surroundings.

I learnt more in the 2 weeks I spent meditating than in the other five years I spent doing everything else.

It&apos;s basically the most healthy coping mechanism, and you can’t get through NoFap without a few of those.


When you&apos;re in control over your emotions, then you can remain calm and not relapse under these situations.

Of course, chances are that you are PMOing because you never had control over your emotions. Well, meditation will help you with that.

				<title>Well, as I say. The reason why it takes people 5 years&apos; on average to overcome their porn addiction is because they spend 4 and a half years not commiting and doing everything under the sun except commit, before finally realising that they&apos;ve had enough and they&apos;re finally going to actually do something meaningful like meditate.</title>
