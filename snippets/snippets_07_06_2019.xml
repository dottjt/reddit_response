				<title>Meditation - Benefits</title>
				<content>Yeah, meditation was what made the biggest difference for me. In fact, within 5 minutes of meditation was when I knew I would never relapse again and here I am at 200+ days. What&apos;s hard is convincing people to do it though, myself included. I resisted for years, but the moment I started doing it, I felt like such an idiot for being so stubborn haha.

Have you checked out my website before? It explains quite a lot of this stuff, you might find it useful.

				<title>Meditation - Consistency</title>
				<content>Yeah, meditation isn&apos;t effective if it&apos;s not consistent. It&apos;s a bit like dieting. You can&apos;t just diet for a week, and then splurge afterwards. It&apos;s about creating that lifestyle of balance and developing a mental health routine which allows you to develop control over your mind. So definitely it&apos;s something you should be doing daily.

You may possibly be doing it wrong as well, I know I was for years without realising it. Like, are you doing it with your eyes closed? Because that can be problematic if you&apos;re starting out, and well, in general.

So for me, I basically do 10 minutes of meditation each day and I would say that&apos;s enough for you to get started.

The homepage is quite comprehensive. I&apos;ve put a lot of effort into it and it covers 90% of what you need to know. It then leads to the /guide which explains even more about awareness, meditation etc.

Also happy to have you join our #accountability channel on Discord once you&apos;ve become familiar with the material.</title>

				<content>No worries! It&apos;s a lot of work building the website, but it will be worth it in the end to help others :)

Definitely the main feature is our Discord channel where I&apos;ve setup an accountability program.

Essentially you post once a day with the healthy coping mechanisms you practiced for that day, and our NFD bot interacts with you various ways, and it&apos;s proven super successful so far in keeping people committed. Not to mention we have a super friendly and open community, let me know if you&apos;re interested!

I also have a subreddit if you&apos;re interested in keeping up-to-date with developments to the website, podcast etc. r/NeverFapDeluxe</content>

				<content>The biggest difference is probably the energy I have now. Like, put it this way, I haven&apos;t thought about porn in months. Which means I haven&apos;t experienced any of the guilt/shame/drain of porn on a daily basis, not to mention my emotions have remained stable and it&apos;s literally night and day in terms of difference. This alone is a huge motivator never to go back.</content>

				<title>meditation-advice</title>
				<content>Meditation is basically the difference between making it a few weeks, to making it a few years. Essentially, if you don&apos;t have control over your emotions by remaining calm, then it’s hard to say that you’re ultimately in control of anything.

Put it this way, I learnt more in the 2 weeks I spent meditating than in the other five years I spent doing everything else. I cannot recommend it enough, and here I am 4 months into NoFap and honestly, feeling invulnerable everyday.

I tend to find that meditation helps greatly to control my urges. Except, well, I don&apos;t have urges anymore simply due to meditation.
The problem is that once you have an urge, it&apos;s generally too late. Only by regularly training your mind can you have full control over your emotions and really have an easy time with NoFap.

				<content>Meditation essentially takes

What&apos;s going to help is if you calm down.

Only by calming down can you take take back control over your emotions, and act effectively, as opposed to struggling as you currently are. I understand that it&apos;s difficult, but you&apos;re making it difficult for yourself by choosing to react and not simply let go.


Ultimately, meditation is about being aware of your senses. So for example, sitting there and noticing your emotions and physical sensations without reacting to is, as well as observing your surroundings.

I learnt more in the 2 weeks I spent meditating than in the other five years I spent doing everything else.

It&apos;s basically the most healthy coping mechanism, and you can’t get through NoFap without a few of those.


When you&apos;re in control over your emotions, then you can remain calm and not relapse under these situations.

Of course, chances are that you are PMOing because you never had control over your emotions. Well, meditation will help you with that.
