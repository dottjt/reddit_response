// <content>Hey, I saw your post on r/NoFap. I&apos;m sorry to hear you relapsed. How are you currently coping? Were you meditating daily in order to help deal with your feelings and emotions?

const middleWrittenGuide = (
`Well, I&apos;ve written a guide to the whole process of overcoming porn addiction if you&apos;re interested? (don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s 100% completely free, just trying to help as many people out as possible)

It explains everything from healthy coping mechanisms, to developing control over your emotions, as well as setting healthy expectations throughout your journey.

The homepage is quite comprehensive. I&apos;ve put a lot of effort into it and it covers 90% of what you need to know. It then leads to the /guide which explains even more about awareness, meditation etc.

Also happy to have you join our #accountability channel on Discord once you&apos;ve become familiar with the material.
