`Hey, I saw your post on r/NoFap.

I'm sorry to hear you're struggling so much. I certainly don't mean to sound rude (definitely just trying to provide some perspective), but based on what you described it sounds like you don't have the fundamentals down.

Like, if you're worried about counting streaks or distracting yourself or trying to block porn or trying to define what constitutes as relapse, then you're merely focusing on the symptoms, as opposed to the cause. The state of your mental health.

Ultimately what's important is having balance and being mentally healthy, and I didn't see you mention those things or how you can improve upon those things in your post. Honestly, once you get the fundamentals down, recovery becomes super easy. Because you're no longer fighting yourself and your feelings. Hell, you don't even have urges anymore.

What kind of things do you do for your mental health each day? Do you meditate or practice awareness exercises?

`Hey, I saw your post on r/NoFap.

Definitely meditation was what made the biggest difference for me. In fact, within 5 minutes of meditation was when I knew I would never relapse again and here I am at 250+ days. What&apos;s hard is convincing people to do it though, myself included. I resisted for years, but the moment I started doing it, I felt like such an idiot for being so stubborn haha.

Meditation also isn&apos;t effective if it&apos;s not consistent. It&apos;s a bit like dieting. You can&apos;t just diet for a week, and then splurge afterwards. It&apos;s about creating that lifestyle of balance and developing a mental health routine which allows you to develop control over your mind. So definitely it&apos;s something you should be doing daily.

So for me, I basically do 10 minutes of meditation each day and I would say that&apos;s enough for you to get started.

Thought you could use some advice to help you get further with your own recovery :D

`Hey, I saw your post on r/NoFap.

There is literally never any reason to masturbate or watch porn, ever. The only reason why you would have a desire to do it is because you're addicted to it, otherwise you wouldn't be having this thought at all.

`Hey, I saw your post on r/NoFap. I&apos;m sorry to hear you relapsed. How are you currently coping? Were you meditating daily in order to help deal with your feelings and emotions?

If you're struggling with recovery, it might mean that you don't have the basics down. Recovery should relatively effortless, otherwise what's the point in being porn free if you feel like crap all the time?

I&apos;m sorry to hear you relapsed. How are you currently coping?`
