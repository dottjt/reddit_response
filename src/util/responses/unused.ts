// I'm sorry to hear you're struggling. Based on what you described it sounds like you don't have the fundamentals down. Like, if you're worried about distracting yourself, blocking porn or counting streaks, then it sounds like you're merely focusing on the symptoms. Not the cause, which is having poor mental health.

// Ultimately what's important is having balance and having mental health. Once you get those things down recovery becomes a lot easier, because you're no longer fighting yourself and your feelings.

// What kind of things do you do for your mental health each day? Do you meditate or practice awareness exercises? I've created a website which explains overcoming porn addiction which explains this stuff in detail, if you're interested.

// Definitely meditation was what made the biggest difference for me. In fact, within 5 minutes of meditation was when I knew I would never relapse again.

// So for me, I basically do 10 minutes of meditation each day and I would say that's enough for you to get started. I've created a website which explains why, if you're interested.

//   I think you'll find that recovery is about focusing on your mental health, not so much about your physical health. Although physical activity can help tremendously, it doesn't address the heart of the problem which is not having control over your mind.

//   Otherwise, you end up using exercise as a form of distraction and that's no different to procrastinating. I've created a website which explains overcoming porn addiction which explains this in detail, if you're interested.

//   Essentially, you're no longer addicted when you have zero desire to do it. As in, never again. Up until then, you're still very much addicted. In most cases, if you can get past 90 days then it demonstrates that you're no longer addicted, but I would also say it's just a general guide.

//   Ultimately it's about working on your mental health everyday. Keep that up and you'll get there, but it involves a lot of practice and remembering to meditate daily. I've created a website which explains overcoming porn addiction which explains this stuff in detail, if you're interested.

// and here I am at 250+ days. What's hard is convincing people to do it though, myself included. I resisted for years, but the moment I started doing it, I felt like such an idiot for being so stubborn haha.
// Meditation also isn't effective if it's not consistent. It's a bit like dieting. You can't just diet for a week, and then splurge afterwards. It's about creating that lifestyle of balance and developing a mental health routine which allows you to develop control over your mind. So definitely it's something you should be doing daily.
