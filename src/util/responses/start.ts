`Hey, I saw your post on ${forum}.

If you're looking for some advice, I've created a website which explains the whole process of overcoming porn addiction. The homepage should cover 90% of how NeverFap Deluxe works. A lot of people also find the NeverFap Deluxe Podcast useful as well. It goes into meditation, healthy coping mechanisms and the basics of recovery.

Also happy to have you join the #accountability program on Discord once you've become familiar with the material. Our bot tracks your days and progress.

`Hey, I saw your post on ${forum}. It's great to see you've started!

The main thing with recovery is to focus on your mental health. Fundamentally, it's about developing the awareness to change your behaviours so you can learn to develop control over your mind. Of course, that's a lot easier said than done, which is why it requires A LOT of practice. Which is where having a daily mental health routine comes in, and is so important.

Do you do much for your mental health? Like meditate, and stuff? Personally I do 10 minutes of meditation each day and that's enough for me. I've also created a website which explains the whole process of overcoming porn addiction, if you're interested.

There is literally never any reason to masturbate or watch porn, ever. The only reason why you would have a desire to do it is because you're addicted to it, otherwise you wouldn't be having this thought at all.

It's about creating that lifestyle of balance and developing a mental health routine which allows you to develop control over your mind. So definitely it's something you should be doing daily.
