The main thing with recovery is to focus on your mental health. Fundamentally, it's about developing the awareness to change your behaviours so you can learn to develop control over your mind. Of course, that's a lot easier said than done, which is why it requires A LOT of practice.

Do you do much for your mental health? Like meditate, and stuff? Personally I do 10 minutes of meditation each day and that's enough for me. I've also created a website which explains the whole process of overcoming porn addiction, if you're interested.

The main thing with flatline is to focus on the process. Emotions and feelings come and go, but the process always remains the same. This means focusing on your mental health, because all those things you're feeling like low energy and low motivation are merely symptoms, not the cause of the problem.

There is literally never any reason to masturbate or watch porn, ever. The only reason why you would have a desire to do it is because you're addicted to it, otherwise you wouldn't be having this thought at all.

There is no such thing as reasonable when it comes to addiction. I've created a website which explains why, if you're interested.

If it helps, I've written a guide to overcoming porn addiction which may help them? It may also help you understand the dynamics of porn addiction as well.

I started watching porn when I was 10, recovered by 25, now 27. So it's definitely something that can be addressed successfully if you focus on your mental health and remain consistent with the process. Now I honestly don't think about porn or masturbation at all.

export const masturbateWithoutPornAdvice = (forum?: string): string => (
`Hey, I saw your post${forum ? `on ${forum}` : ''}.

While there's nothing inherently wrong with masturbation itself, what I will say is that it makes the process of recovery so much more difficult than it needs to be.

In most cases it's a trigger to watch porn and orgasm itself also makes it really hard to maintain clarity during recovery. I've also created a website which explains the whole process of overcoming porn addiction, if you're interested.

export const biggestBenefitPostAddictionAdvice = (forum?: string): string => (
`Hey, I saw your post${forum ? `on ${forum}` : ''}.

Possibly the biggest benefit for me is simply not having to think about porn/masturbation at all. The amount of time saved daily that I can spend on other things is tremendous. Not to mention the cost my addiction had on my mental health, as well as on my ability to concentrate and actually get stuff done.

Just having the mental clarity that I have now is alone worth it for me. It's like I can be fully consistent with my ambitiosn and endeavours without crashing at all.

Ultimately recovery should be relatively struggle free, and the only way you're going to achieve that is by having mental balance. Fundamentally speaking, it's about developing the awareness to change your behaviours so you can learn to develop control over your mind. Once you have that control it becomes trivial.
