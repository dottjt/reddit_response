`Yeah, you might have a hard time addressing your addiction without first developing a mental health routine and focusing on your mental health on a daily basis. Especially given addiction is a mental health problem at it's core.

Ultimately the important thing is being consistent with your mental health, which the NeverFap Deluxe website explains in detail. Usually this means at least 10 minutes meditation each day. So if you can commit to that you'll be fine.
